# 第一题- leetcode 310.Minimum Height Trees

**Description:**For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees \(MHTs\). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.
