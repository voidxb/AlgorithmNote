# 第一题- leetcode 310.Minimum Height Trees

#### **Description**

For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees \(MHTs\). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

**Format**

The graph contains`n`nodes which are labeled from`0`to`n - 1`. You will be given the number`n`and a list of undirected`edges`\( each edge is a pair of labels\).
